## Dashboard Ideas

### 1. Crash Overview Statistics:

- **Total Number of Crashes**: Display the total number of crashes over a specific time period.
- **Crashes by Severity**: Breakdown of crashes by injury severity (e.g., fatal, incapacitating, non-incapacitating, no injuries).
- **Crashes by Type**: Breakdown of crash types (e.g., collisions, hit-and-run, dooring incidents).
- **Crashes by Time**: Number of crashes by time of day, day of the week, and month of the year.
- **Crashes in Work Zones**: Number of crashes occurring in construction work zones.

### 2. Geographic Analysis:

- **Crash Locations on Map**: A heat map or pinpoint map of crash locations based on latitude and longitude, showing areas with high crash frequencies.
- **Top 10 Streets/Intersections for Crashes**: Identify streets or intersections with the highest number of crashes.
- **Crashes by Police Beat**: A map breakdown by CPD Beat, showing crash statistics in each area.
- **Road Conditions and Crashes**: Visualize crashes based on road surface conditions, traffic control devices, or street alignment.

### 3. Weather and Lighting Conditions:

- **Crashes by Weather Condition**: Display crashes segmented by weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, snow, fog).
- **Lighting Conditions at Time of Crash**: Crashes broken down by lighting conditions (e.g., daylight, night, dawn/dusk).

### 4. Vehicle and Unit Information:

- **Vehicle Types Involved in Crashes**: Distribution of vehicle types involved in crashes (e.g., cars, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles, pedestrians).
- **Vehicle Defects**: Display data on vehicles with reported defects at the time of the crash.
- **Vehicle Maneuvers**: Show most common vehicle maneuvers prior to crashes (e.g., turning, merging, going straight).

### 5. Injury and Fatality Analysis:

- **Total Injuries and Fatalities**: Visualize the total number of injuries and fatalities resulting from crashes.
- **Injury Severity Breakdown**: Show breakdowns of injuries by severity classification (e.g., fatal, incapacitating, non-incapacitating).
- **Injuries by Road User Type**: Compare injuries between drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists.
- **Crash Types Leading to Most Injuries/Fatalities**: Identify crash types that result in the most severe outcomes.

### 6. Driver and Pedestrian Behavior:

- **Driver Actions Leading to Crashes**: Display contributing driver actions leading to crashes (e.g., speeding, distracted driving, failure to yield).
- **Pedestrian and Cyclist Actions**: Analyze pedestrian or cyclist actions at the time of the crash (e.g., crossing mid-block, using crosswalks).

### 7. Traffic Violations and Contributing Causes:

- **Primary and Secondary Causes of Crashes**: Analyze the most common primary and secondary contributory causes (e.g., speeding, DUI, weather conditions).
- **Speeding-Related Crashes**: Show data on crashes where vehicles exceeded the speed limit, including posted speed limits in crash areas.
- **Hit-and-Run Analysis**: Visualize data on hit-and-run incidents, including geographic patterns and injury outcomes.

### 8. Emergency Response and Outcomes:

- **EMS Response Times**: Analyze EMS response times to crash scenes and the hospitals victims were taken to.
- **Airbag Deployment and Safety Equipment Usage**: Display data on airbag deployment, seatbelt usage, and other safety measures.

### 9. Temporal Trends:

- **Trends Over Time**: Show long-term trends in crash numbers, injuries, fatalities, and severity.
- **Monthly or Weekly Crash Reports**: Provide an up-to-date look at crash statistics for a selected time frame (e.g., month, quarter, year).

### 10. Filtering and Customization:

- **Filter by Location**: Allow users to filter crash data by a specific neighborhood, street, or police beat.
- **Filter by Date Range**: Enable selection of specific time frames to view crash data trends over a customized period.
- **Filter by Crash Type**: Filter dashboard views based on crash types (e.g., pedestrian crashes, vehicle collisions).

### 11. Safety Insights and Recommendations:

- **Areas with High Fatalities or Severe Injuries**: Highlight dangerous areas with higher occurrences of severe injuries or fatalities.
- **Recommendations Based on Data**: Suggest potential safety improvements based on data, such as improving lighting, signage, or speed enforcement in high-crash areas.
